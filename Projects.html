            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>According to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/data-wrangling">IBM</a>, data wrangling is the process of cleaning, structuring, and enriching raw data to be used in data science, machine learning (ML), and other data-driven applications.
                It addresses data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, outliers, and formatting inconsistencies. </p>
            <h3>Objectives</h3>

            <h2>History of the Titanic</h2>
            <p>The RMS Titanic was a British cruise ship that sank on April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City. It was the largest ship in the world at the time, measuring 882 feet long and 92 feet wide, and displacing
                52,310 long tons. The Titanic departed from Southampton on April 10, 1912, stopping at the French port of Cherbourg and the Irish port of Queenstown to pick up more passengers before setting off across the Atlantic Ocean. Despite receiving
                several ice warnings, the Titanic continued at full speed, and at 11 p.m. on April 14, 1912, lookout Fred Fleet spotted an iceberg dead ahead. First Officer William Murdoch ordered the ship turned hard to port and signaled the engine room
                to reverse direction, but the ship was too large, moving too fast, and the iceberg was too close. The Titanic struck the iceberg, causing several compartments to begin filling with water. The ship’s design included a double-hull and 16
                watertight compartments sealed by massive doors that could be instantly triggered by a single electric switch on the bridge or automatically by electric water-sensors. However, the ship was not designed to withstand a collision that would
                flood more than four compartments, and the iceberg had caused five compartments to begin filling with water. The ship began to sink, and the crew began to get people aboard the lifeboats. There were not enough lifeboats for all the passengers,
                and many left the Titanic only half full. The Titanic sank at 2 a.m. on April 15, 1912, with approximately 1,500 people still on board. The disaster led to the establishment of the International Ice Patrol and the first International Convention
                for Safety of Life at Sea, which required every ship to have lifeboat space for each person embarked, hold lifeboat drills, and maintain a 24-hour radio watch.</p>
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>To conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic dataset. This includes Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate, Outlier, and Target Analysis of the data. The dataset was obtained from this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/mariyamalshatta/masterclass-1-a-comprehensive-guide-for-eda"><i>link</i></a></p>

            <p>The image below shows the relationship between <i>Passenger Class</i>, <i>Sex</i>, and <i>Survival</i>. Majority of passengers who survived the accident were in 1st class compared to 2nd and 3rd classes. 3rd class experiences the highest death
                rates.

            <h3>Outlier Handling</h3>
            <p>
                Outliers cannot be removed because:
                <ul class="list-item">
                    <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i>It can lead to loss of valuable information, distorting the dataset and/or tampering with the integrity of the data</br>
                    <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i>It can be used to detect rare events such as elderly surviving the titanic accident as seen in the dataset</br>
                    <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i>It can be used to improve predictions during modeling in future and support insights</br>
                    <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i>It can introduce biasness in the dataset especially if the outlier is meaningful and not an error, or processing</br>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>61.62% of the population succumbed to the accident compared to 38.38% who survived. Majority of passengers who boarded the titanic were between the age of 20 and 40 accounting for the young adults in the population. Majority of passengers
                in the 3rd class died compared to 1st and 2nd class. Majority of men succumbed to the accident compared to women. Majority of the passengers who succumbed to the accident were destined for Southampton port. However, there was an exception
                case of an elderly who survived accident that need to be looked into</p>

            <!-- <h2>Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning Techniques</h2> -->
            <p>K-Means clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that is suitable for working with unlabelled data that lacks predefined categories or groups. The primary objective of this segment is to group similar data points together, with the
                number of groups determined by the value of K. The algorithm follows an iterative approach and assigns each data point to one of the K groups based on the features that are provided.</p>
            <h3>About the business - Selore</h3>
            <p>Selore Nigeria is a popular electronics retail chain in Nigeria that specializes in the sale of mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and other related accessories. The company was founded in 2022 and has since grown to become one of the largest
                retailers of mobile phones and related products in the country. Selore Nigeria offers a wide range of mobile phones from top brands such as Samsung, Apple, Nokia, and Huawei, among others. The company is also known for its after- sales
                support, including repairs and maintenance services, as well as trade-in options for old devices. With its numerous outlets nationwide, Selore Nigeria is a go-to destination for many Nigerians seeking to purchase mobile phones and related
                accessories.
            </p>
            <h3>Business Problem</h3>
            <p>A retail company wants to understand the spending behaviour of its customers to target them with personalized marketing campaigns. They have collected data on customer demographics (age, gender) and spending habits (annual income, spending
                score) and want to segment their customers based on their spending behaviour. The objective of this project is to build a customer segmentation model to help the retail company in developing targeted marketing strategies.</p>
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>The goal of this project is to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviour and demographic information. We will use unsupervised learning techniques to identify groups of customers with similar behaviour and characteristics. This
                information can be used to develop targeted marketing campaigns, personalize product recommendations, and optimize pricing strategies.</p>
            <p>The retail company has collected data on 200 customers containing:
                <ul class="list-item">
                    <i class="fas fa-check-square"></i>CustomerID</br>
